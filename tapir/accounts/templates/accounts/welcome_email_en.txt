Dear {{ user.get_full_name }},

we just created an account for you in our SuperCoop member system. Here you can view your upcoming shifts, book an additional shift if you'd like or mark your shift as “looking for a stand-in” (for example when you go on vacation). Please see the Member Manual (pages 12-14) for more information on the Stand-in System.
{% if user.shift_user_data.attendance_mode == "regular" %}
{% if user.shift_attendance_templates.first %}
Your regular ABCD-shift is: {{ user.shift_attendance_templates.first.slot_template.get_display_name }}. You will receive a reminder email in advance of your first shift.
{% endif %}
{% else %}
Flying members: Please keep in mind that you must have at least one shift “banked” for each shift cycle. For more information please see the Member Manual (page 11).
{% endif %}
In the future you will also be able to log in to the SuperCoop wiki with that account.

Your username is {{ user.username }}.
In order to login to your account, you first have to set a password :

{{ site_url }}{% url "password_reset_confirm" uidb64=uid token=token %}

This link is only valid for a few weeks. Should it expire, you can get a new one here : {{ site_url }}{% url "password_reset" %}
Alternatively, as for any other question, you can always contact the member's office : https://wiki.supercoop.de/wiki/Mitgliederb%C3%BCro_-_Member_Office

Cooperative regards,
Your SuperCoop Berlin member's office team.
